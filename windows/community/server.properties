#         Persistit attempts to write them within 100 milliseconds,
#         but this interval is not guaranteed.
# HARD  - does not return until all updates created by the transaction
#         have been written to non-volatile storage.
# GROUP - does not return until all updates created by the transaction
#         have been written to non-volatile storage. In addition, the
#         committing transaction waits briefly in an attempt to
#         recruit other concurrently running transactions to write
#         their updates with the same physical I/O operation.
