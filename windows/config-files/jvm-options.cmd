REM This file is for Windows. For Unix-like systems, look in jvm.options.
REM It is important that none of the property values have spaces in them.

REM The amount of memory to allocate to the JVM at startup, you almost
REM certainly want to adjust this for your environment.
REM SET MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1024M

REM Here we create the arguments that will get passed to the jvm when starting.

REM enable thread priorities, primarily so we can give periodic tasks
REM a lower priority to avoid interfering with client workload
SET JVM_OPTS=%JVM_OPTS% -XX:+UseThreadPriorities
REM allows lowering thread priority without being root.  see
REM http://tech.stolsvik.com/2010/01/linux-java-thread-priorities-workaround.html
SET JVM_OPTS=%JVM_OPTS% -XX:ThreadPriorityPolicy=42

REM min and max heap sizes should be set to the same value to avoid
REM stop-the-world GC pauses during resize, and so that we can lock the
REM heap in memory on startup to prevent any of it from being swapped
REM out.
