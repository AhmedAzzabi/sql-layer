+ table -> group, e.g. IndexedTableScan, FullTableScan, table arg of IndexedTableScan

- IndexedTableScan arg: types to retrieve to complete a group. E.g. if
  input hkeys are from order, then we'll already be getting orders and
  items. arg of [customer, address] says to get the customer of the
  order, and all that customers addresses, and to interleave these
  correctly with the orders and items. (Assuming later operator,
  e.g. flatten or select, needs hkey ordered data within each
  customer.)

  Actually, order of siblings probably don't matter. select, flatten
  should work OK as long as customer is before both addresses and
  orders.

- Separate logical and physical operators.
