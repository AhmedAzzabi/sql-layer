# Mapping of known collation names to internal "scheme" values.
# A scheme consists of a locale name and an ICU4J collator strength.
# Strength value 1 means that case-independent, strength 2 and above
# are case-sensitive and sensitive to other differences such as accents, etc.
#
# A special non-locale name "UCS_BINARY" implies that the collation should 
# be based on the binary encoding of the string. Several name variations used
# in Akiban Server tests are provided here.
#
# The intent of this file is to include both the relevant MySQL collation 
# name and a more general local name.  The general format is xx-uu where
# xx is a language code (ISO-639) such as "es" (Spanish), "en" (English)
# etc. and yy is a control code (ISO-3166) such as "us" (USA) or "gb"
# Great Britain. In this properties file all property names must be spelled
# in lower case, and the match on name is case-insensitive.
#
# Only those collation schemes that have been tested for at least
# plausible correctness should be included in this file.
#
# MySQL collations specify the character set, locale and case-insensitivity.
# In Akiban Server, the character set is handled separately since all strings
# are internally stored and managed in Unicode form.
