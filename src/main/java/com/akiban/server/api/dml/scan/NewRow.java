 *
 * <p>Rows should be able to accept <tt>null</tt> values, which should be distinct from unset values. So the following
 * are <strong>not</strong> equivalent:
 * <pre>   {1: 'foo', 2: null }
 * {1: 'foo' }</pre>

 * and <tt>equals</tt> implementation which are not compatible with this class; in particular, this class's equality
 * and hash should take its TableId into consideration.</p>
